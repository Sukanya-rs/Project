Profile Your Code to Improve Performance using MATLAB Profiler\n","Profiling is a way to measure the time takes to run your code and identify where MATLAB spends most of the time.  After you identify which functions are consuming the most time, you can evaluate them for possible performance improvements. You also can profile your code to determine which lines of code do not run. Determining which lines of code do not run is useful when developing tests for your code, or as a debugging tool to help isolate a problem in your code."],"metadata":{"id":"Z3Q9wW2uRD-S"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tic\n","#Caesar's Cipher\n","def shift(s, n):\n","  return ''.join(chr((ord(char) - 97 - n) % 26 + 97) for char in s)\n","\n","list_1 =['fjsir', 'vnjk', 'eioafnvjf', 'einbvfbj']\n","list_2 =[3,4,7,1]\n","\n","for x, y in zip(list_1, list_2):\n","  print(shift(x, y))\n","toc"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":232},"id":"wPOTHbyUQPsh","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1651989903090,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"skn","userId":"17986800113033759127"}},"outputId":"b222e189-a375-495f-d36d-f645e0858d69"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-7-9ba814cd65a0>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mtic\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m#Caesar's Cipher\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mdef\u001b[0m \u001b[0mshift\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0ms\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mn\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m   \u001b[0;32mreturn\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m''\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mjoin\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mchr\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mord\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mchar\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m97\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m-\u001b[0m \u001b[0mn\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m%\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m26\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m+\u001b[0m \u001b[0;36m97\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mfor\u001b[0m \u001b[0mchar\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0ms\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'tic' is not defined"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 3.
